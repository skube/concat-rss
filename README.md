# concat-rss
[Automatically combines](https://rawgit.com/skube/concat-rss/master/index.html) RSS URLs for Craigslist and Kijiji to be used with something like RSS Mix.

The goal is to create a simple Angular app (for learning purposes) which can easily and quickly create a string which can be easily copied into [RSS Mix](http://www.rssmix.com/)

The output should be in the format :
```
http://toronto.craigslist.ca/search/sss?hasPic=1&max_price=900&min_price=100&query=mac%20mini%20i7%20quad&sort=rel&format=rss
http://www.kijiji.ca/rss-srp-city-of-toronto/mac-mini-i7-quad/k0l1700273?price=100__900&minNumberOfImages=1
```
