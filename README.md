# concat-rss
Simple angular app to create &amp; concatenate RSS strings for use with RSS Mix

As a way to learn a little about AngularJS. Basically the goal is to create a simple app which can easily, and quickly create a string which can be easily copied into [RSS Mix](http://www.rssmix.com/)

The output should be in the format :
```
http://toronto.craigslist.ca/search/sss?hasPic=1&max_price=900&min_price=100&query=mac%20mini%20i7%20quad&sort=rel&format=rss

```
